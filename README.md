# Price Prediction Model

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a model to predict the price of clothing items based on features such as brand, category, color, size, and material. Utilizing a dataset of 1000 entries, the project aims to provide insights into the factors that most significantly impact the pricing of these items, and develop a predictive model that can assist retailers and consumers in understanding price determinants.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for this project contains the following columns:

- `Brand`: The brand of the clothing item (e.g., New Balance, Under Armour).
- `Category`: The category of the item (e.g., Dress, Jeans, Shoes).
- `Color`: The color of the item (e.g., White, Black, Red).
- `Size`: The size of the item (e.g., XS, M).
- `Material`: The material from which the item is made (e.g., Nylon, Silk, Wool).
- `Price`: The price of the item in USD.

There are a total of 1000 rows in the dataset, each representing a unique clothing item. There are no missing or duplicated rows, indicating a clean dataset ready for analysis and model training.
